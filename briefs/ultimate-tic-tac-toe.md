Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a variation on the classic children's game. In this version, each cell of the Tic Tac Toe board is a game of Tic Tac Toe. Winning a smaller game, places that player's token (X or O) in the larger game's cell.

The first player can choose any of the smaller boards to start on. Whichever cell they choose will determine the board that the opponent will play on. If the board is completed, the opponent can choose any board to play on.

The aim is to win the larger Tic Tac Toe game.

## Resources

* [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe: The Rules - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37PC0bGMiTI)
* [Ultimate tic-tac-toe - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe)

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for two players on the same computer, taking turns to make their moves
* The winner should be displayed when the game is over

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Single player mode with the computer attempting reasonable moves

## Challenges

The first challenge is to make a standard Tic Tac Toe game with win condition. Once this has been achieved the larger game also needs to be implemented. A good use of Object Oriented Programming (read constructor functions), can be very helpful here.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
