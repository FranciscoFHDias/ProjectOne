The idea of Frogger is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.

To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.

* [Frogger arcade game - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9fO-YuWPSk)
* [Frogger - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for one player.
* The obstacles should be auto generated.

## Suggested enhancements

* Different difficulty levels.
* Auto generated boards.
* Two player mode on the same computer: players take turns the first to lose more lives across a whole game loses.
* High score board with `localStorage`

## Challenges

The main difficulty here is animating the obstacles and detecting collision. There will be a number of timers to manage across the whole game, which can be easily get out of hand.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
