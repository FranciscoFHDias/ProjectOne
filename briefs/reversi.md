Reversi, sometimes known as Othello is a strategy board game for two players. Each player takes turns in laying a counter (or disc), which is light on one side, and dark on the other on the board. The disc is laid with the player's colour face up in line with another of their discs, with their opponents discs in between. The player can now flip all the opponents discs in between theirs, turning them to their colour.

Once all the squares have been filled, the player with the most pieces with their colour face up wins.

## Challenges

The logic to this game is reasonably mathematical, and can take some time to reach, and so will require a large amount of trial and error and refactoring.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
