Pac Man is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The player aims eat all the food in a maze whilst being hunted by ghosts.

If the player eats special flashing food the ghosts start to flash and can now be captured by the player, sending them back to their holding pen, from where they can once again start to hunt the player.

The aim is to achieve the highest score possible before being killed by the ghosts.

* [Pac-Man Arcade gameplay - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uswzriFIf_k)
* [Pac-Man - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)

## Requirements

* The player should be able to clear at least one board
* The player's score should be displayed at the end of the game

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Each board gets more difficult
* Persistent leaderboard using `localStorage`

## Challenges

The biggest challenge here is the logic which moves the ghosts. While their movement may appear random, they are always moving toward Pac Man, who is himself being moved by the player.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
