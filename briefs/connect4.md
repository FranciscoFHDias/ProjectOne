Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

The winner is the first to create a line of four in any direction, including diagonally. If the board is filled before a line of 4 can be made, the game is declared a draw.

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for two players on the same computer, taking turns to make their moves
* The winner should be displayed when the game is over

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Single player mode with the computer making reasonable moves

## Challenges

The most difficult aspect of this game is the win condition, since the whole board must be checked for for pieces in a row in any direction, including diagonals, after each move. If attempting the single player game, the logic to decide which square to play is similarly challenging.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
