Minesweeper is a classic Windows PC game. The idea is to decide which tile mines are hidden under based on numbered clues hidden under the remaining tiles.

If the player clicks on a tile that a mine is under the game is immediately over and the board is cleared to reveal the location of all the mines.

If the player manages to work out where all the mines are located without actually clicking on them, then they clear the board, and can move on to the next level.

* [Minesweeper (video game) - Wikipedia][1]

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for one player, playing against the computer
* The board should be automatically cleared when the level is cleared

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Random board generation
* Different board sizes

## Challenges

Automatically revealing empty squares, and automatically generating the board is by far the most complex challenge that you will face when making this game. The MVP is rather advanced, so be aware that you may not have much to show until towards the end of the project.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
