## Brief

The player can only move left or right. The aliens also move from left to right, and down each time they reach the side of the screen. Bombs will also drop towards the player.

The player will win when all aliens die. The aim is for the player to achieve the highest score possible by killing aliens or destroying bombs before either destroying all aliens, being destroyed by a bomb, or allowing the aliens to reach the planet.

## Project OvervieW

## Approach taken - Thought process & methods of producing it
* Snippets of your code and screenshots of your project

## Wins and Blockers
* The main challenge here is the movement of large groups of aliens in formation, and the animation of the bombs and player's shots. There are several approaches here, with collision detection being the more challenging.


## Future features
* Responsive design
* Each wave gets more difficult
* Persistent leaderboard using `localStorage`

## What you have learned (tech & soft skills)
* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
